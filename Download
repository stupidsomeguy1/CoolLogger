How to Download CoolLogger:
Firstly, go to this mediafire link to download the package - https://www.mediafire.com/file/j8ynakzinpxbo0f/CoolLogger.zip/file
Why MediaFire? Our package is way to heavy to carry on github, its at least 26 MB, the reason is that we have so many methods that its just to big for github.
Once you have downloaded, extract ALL of the files to desktop (make sure anti-virus is off) then proceed to run "setup.bat" then from there setup your stub
